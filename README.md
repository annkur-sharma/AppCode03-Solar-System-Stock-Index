# 🌌 Solar System Stock Index
A fun Java web application built with Maven and deployed as a WAR file on Apache Tomcat.
This app simulates a stock ticker where planetary systems are represented as stock indices.

---

# 🚀 Features
- 5 Planetary Indices: Earth, Mars, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn
- Stock names inspired by moons, asteroids, and celestial objects
- Random stock index movement (up/down every refresh)
- Color-coded ticker: 🟢 Green for gains, 🔴 Red for losses
- Auto-refresh every 3 seconds for a real-time feel
- Interactive buttons: click on a planet to view its stock index
- Date & Time display
- Marquee ticker at the bottom like real stock exchanges
- Session GUID stored in cookies – persists for the user session (future-ready for Kubernetes/replica sets)
